# Billiard Match Video Analysis

Didattic project with the objective of creating a computer vision system capable of analysing a "8-Ball" Billiard matches, providing high-level information and displaying it on a 2-D top view minimap.

The resulting system is capable of the following tasks:
- Segmentation of the playing field
- Ball detection
- Ball classification (still in progress)
- Projection of the playing field onto a top planar view
- Trajectory tracking of each ball

The challenging part of the project was to develop such system relying only on traditional computer vision methods such as edge detection, Hough transform, SVM, projective geometry and homography matrix, and in particular without any type of deep neural network involved.
