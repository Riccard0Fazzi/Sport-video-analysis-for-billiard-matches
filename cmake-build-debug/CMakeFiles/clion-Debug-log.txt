CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:5 (target_link_libraries):
  Cannot specify link libraries for target "BiliardVideoAnalysis" which is
  not built by this project.

  CMake does not support this but it used to work accidentally and is being
  allowed for compatibility.

  Policy CMP0016 is not set: target_link_libraries() reports error if its
  only argument is not a target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0016" for
  policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and
  suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
